# Contributing

## Contributing Code

Just open a PR and I'll maybe accept it if I want it, like your code, and
there's no warnings.

Generally, what I want from a PR are:
- Useful features that will be used by the majority of people.
- Fixes to common problems that aren't trivial to work around.
- Bug fixes.

If it doesn't fit any of the above, then you have much lower chances of your
PR being accepted.

### Style Guide
- `camelCase` for variables, methods, functions.
- `_camelCase` for private variables.
- `PascalCase` for classes and structs.
- Opening braces are NOT on a newline. Closing braces are on a newline, unless
the next token is `else`.
- Column limit of 80.
- 2 spaces indentation.
- Classes must start off with a `public:` section, then `protected:`, and then `private:`.
- Labels (`public:`, `case x:`) are indented, and their bodies are indented another level.
- Don't use of the STL, other parts of the STD are okay.
- Don't use exceptions.

## Contributing to the Docs

I'll accept anything to the docs as long as it's grammatically correct,
factually correct, and is generally consistent with the rest of the docs.

### Style Guide
- Column limit of 80.
